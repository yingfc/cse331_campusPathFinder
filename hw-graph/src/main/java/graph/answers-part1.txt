1. Write an AF and RI for IntQueue1 and IntQueue2.

    ### IntQueue1

    Abstraction Function:
        AF(this) = Queue<Integer> entries such that
            queue = entries = [] if there are no elements in entries
            queue = entries = [n1, n2, ..., n_k] that k is the number of elements in entries



    Representation Invariant:
        entries != null
        entries does not contain any null element



    ### IntQueue2

    Abstraction Function:
        AF(this) = Queue<Integer> such that
            entries = [n1, n2, ..., n_k], front = i, size = n
            queue = [] if size = 0
            queue = [a_(i+1), ..., a_(i+n)] if front+size <= entries.length
            queue = [a_(i+1), ..., a_k, a1, ..., a_(k-i)] if front+size > entries.length



    Representation Invariant:
        size >= 0
        front >= 0
        entries != null
        front < entries.length



2. Group the snapshots of IntQueue2's internal state into groups that have the same abstract state.
    queue a = [1, 2]
    queue b = [2, 3, 4]
    queue c = [1, 2, 3]
    queue d = [1, 2]
    queue e = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    queue f = [1, 2, 3]
    queue g = [1, 2]
    queue h = [2, 3, 4]

    Upon the write-up above, queue a, d, g are identical. queue c, f are identical. queue b, h are identical.



3. For each signature below, state and justify in 1-2 sentences (per part) whether the method or constructor
could possibly expose the representation, given the information available. Explain any assumptions you made.

    a. `public int solveEquations(int x, int y, int z)`
        This could never expose the representation because it takes parameters and returns the same
        primitive data type(int) instead of mutable objects. The client can not interact with it.


    b. `public String[] decode(boolean slowly)`
        This is possible to expose the representation because it returns an array of String here and
        array is a mutable type.


    c. `private Date myBirthday()`
        This is possible to expose the representation in the case of the Date type is mutable and the
        returned Data is not a copy of the original Date.


    d. `public String toString()`
        This could never expose the representation because the return type String is immutable.


    e. `public Iterator<Integer> elements()`
        This is possible to expose the representation in the case of the returned Iterator refers
        to the original collection and it has the remove method that client could use to remove
        elements.


    f. `public Deck(List<Card> cards)`
        This is possible to expose the representation in the case of Deck is mutable and it's not
        a copy of the original Deck as client could make modification to it.

Briefly explain why you included the operations you did and why you feel they are a sufficient
interface to a graph. If your design includes multiple classes or interfaces, explain why you
included each one; if not, explain whether you considered additional classes and why you decided
not to include them.

What was your testing strategy for this assignment? How do your script tests and JUnit tests
differ from each other (if they do), and why?
