A few examples of possible Graph representations:

    A: A collection of edges.
    B: An adjacency list, in which each node is associated with a list of its outgoing edges.
    C: An adjacency matrix, which explicitly represents, for every pair ⟨A,B⟩ of nodes, whether there is a link from A to B, and how many.

1. In two or three sentences, explain an advantage and a disadvantage of each of the
representations listed above (for example, in terms of runtime complexity, space
complexity, or ease of implementation).

    A.  Using a collection of edges has the advantage of having the time complexity of O(1) for
    adding edge. Besides, it has very low space complexity.
        But it has the disadvantage of being impossible to store single node that has not outgoing
    edges in a graph. Also, it will take the complexity of O(n) to find the edge connecting typical
    nodeA and nodeB as we need to iterate over the entire collection.

    B.  Using an adjacency list makes getting adjacent edges and adding new edge much easier as
    outgoing edges are already organized in that manner and only takes the runtime complexity of
    O(1) for adding edge.
        But it has the disadvantage of being hard to check the connection between each two nodes
    as we have to iterate over the list to look for the edge connection, resulting a high runtime
    complexity in this case.

    C.  Using an adjacency matrix has the advantage of having runtime complexity of O(1) when
    adding edge.
        But it has the disadvantage of being hard to implement and it will be time consuming to
    look for the connected children nodes as we need to iterate over the pair of nodes for edge
    connections, resulting a high runtime complexity in this case. Also, it has a high space
    complexity because of the matrix structure.



2. In two to three sentences, describe the representation you chose and explain why you
chose it. If you chose to use a different representation than one of the three we described
above, be sure to list its advantages and disadvantages, too.
    My representation is a HashMap of each node being the key and a HashSet of the node's connected
    edges: HashMap<String, HashSet<LabeledEdge>>. For the LabeledEdge type, I used the representation
    of <String dest, String edgeLabel> to store the children/destination node and the edge label.

    The representation has the advantage of having constant time complexity for basic operations
    like getting and adding nodes/edges because of this data structure. And it won't permit duplicates
    as it is stored in set.
    While it has the disadvantage that my representation generally will take higher space complexity
    that just using a collection of edges.

    (Please keep your answers brief and to-the-point.)

1. Describe any new tests you added and why you added them, or why you feel that your original
tests alone are sufficient.

    I feel my original tests alone covered the majority of the methods. When I first design those tests
    in hw5-part1, I've already considered testing on many methods in the ADT classes and that already
    covered many cases. And I also got feedback from the staff telling me that I have good test coverage.

    However, I intentionally left the tests on toString() method as I cannot write JUnit tests without
    implementing the method in hw5-part1.
    Therefore, I've added the tests on toString() method for both the DirectedGraph.java class and its
    inner class named LabeledEdge for better test coverage.


2. Did you make any changes to your specifications as you were implementing your Graph? (yes/no)
If yes, describe your changes and why you made them.

    No. I didn't make any changes to the specifications.
