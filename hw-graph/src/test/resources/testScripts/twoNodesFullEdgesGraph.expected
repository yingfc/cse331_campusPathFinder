# Tests graph with adding two nodes and four edges (2 self-loops)

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add a pair of edges
added edge e11 from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e21 from n2 to n1 in graph1
added edge e22 from n2 to n2 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from n1, and the outgoing edges from n2
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e11) n2(e12)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1(e21) n2(e22)
