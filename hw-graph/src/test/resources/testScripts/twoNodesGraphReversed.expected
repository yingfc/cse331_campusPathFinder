# Tests graph with adding two nodes in reversed order

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes in reversed order
added node n2 to graph1
added node n1 to graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from n1, and the outgoing edges from n2
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are:
the children of n2 in graph1 are:
