# Find path via Dijkstra's algorithm for graph containing only one potential path

created graph graph

added node node1 to graph
added node node2 to graph
added node node3 to graph
added edge 20.000 from node1 to node2 in graph
added edge 13.000 from node2 to node3 in graph

path from node1 to node3:
node1 to node2 with weight 20.000
node2 to node3 with weight 13.000
total cost: 33.000
