Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.

Apart from making previous implementation generic, I fixed the compilation errors in the corresponding
tests because of this change to generic types.
Also, I've modified the javadoc for the graph class as we are using generic types now.
