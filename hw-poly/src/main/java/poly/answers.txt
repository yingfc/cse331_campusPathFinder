1. Multiplication Pseudocode
    r = p * q:
        set r = 0
        foreach term, t_p, in p:
            foreach term, t_q, in q:
                set t_pq to be the multiplication of t_p and t_q
                if any term, t_r, in r has the same degree as t_pq
                    then replace t_r by the sum of t_r and t_pq
                    else insert t_pq to r as a new term


2. Division Pseudocode
    q = u / v:
        set r = u by making a term-by-term copy of all terms in u to r
        set q = 0
        set v_h = the highest degree of v
        while the highest degree of r is greater than or equal to v_h
            set c = coefficient of the highest degree term of r / coefficient of the highest degree term of v
            set d = highest degree of r - v_h
            adding a term with coefficient c and degree d to q
            subtracting (v multiplied by c and with each term's degree increased by d)


3. Division Example: (x3+x-1) / (x+1) = x2-x+2

1. Weakened Rep Invariant
    The constructor RatNum(int n, int d) needs to remove calling gcd() method
    to meet the new rep invariant. This change is more efficient as it bypass
    the procedure of calling gcd(), making the execution to be faster.

    The method checkRep() needs to remove the if check as the rep invariant
    changes. This makes the code more clear and makes the method to run faster
    as it now requires less condition check.

    The methods hashCode() and equals(Object obj) need to add calling gcd()
    method to so that they could treat numbers that are in reduced form and
    numbers that are not in reduced form at same standard. Then, both methods
    could return the correct results. This change is less efficient as it needs
    extra execution of gcd(), making the overall execution time to be longer.

    The method toString() needs to add calling gcd() method to meet the new
    rep invariant. This change is less efficient as it requires extra execution,
    making the overall execution time to be longer.


2. Alternate add, sub, mul, div
    The changes fail to meet the specifications of the methods because the specs
    of these methods don't have @sepc.modifies clause, meaning it should not be
    modified by the methods.
    The changes fail to meet the specifications of the RatNum class because the
    general spec of the class says that RatNum represents an immutable rational
    number, whereas the changes will mutate numbers.


3. Constructor checkReps
    The reason why calling checkRep only at the end of the constructors is already
    sufficient is that the denom is set to 1 in constructor RatNum(int n), and this
    won't violate the rep invariant. And denom is set to -d in case of being negative
    at first in the constructor RatNum(int n, int d), and this won't violate the rep
    invariant. Additionally, RatNum class represents immutable rational numbers.
    These instance variables are initialized at the very beginning and declared as
    final, and no methods could even modify them as they are just doing arithmetic
    work. Therefore, calling checkRep only at the end of the constructors is
    sufficient to maintain the rep invariant.

1. Calls to checkRep in RatTerm
    I include calls to the checkRep at the end of the constructor RatTerm(RatNum c, int e).
    The reason is that RatTerm is an immutable representation of a term in a single-variable
    polynomial expression. The instance variables are initialized at the beginning and
    declared as final, and no method could modify them as all methods are returning new
    RatTerm object, leaving the original objects unmodified. Therefore, calling the checkRep
    at the end of the constructor is sufficient to meet the rep invariant.


2. Weakened Rep Invariant
    The constructor RatTerm(RatNum c, int e) needs to remove the part that checks coeff to set expt.
    This change makes the code clear and reduces the execution time.

    The method add(RatTerm arg) needs to add a check for the condition that both this.coeff and arg.coeff
    are ZERO, and return RatTerm.ZERO in case of both are ZERO. This change makes the code more complex
    and may takes longer execution time(very tiny) as it requires further condition check.

    The method toString() needs to add a call of method isZero() to check if the coeff is equal to
    ZERO and return 0 accordingly. This change makes the code more complex and may takes longer
    execution time(very tiny) as it requires further condition check.

    The method equals(Object obj) needs to add a check for both this.coeff and obj are ZERO, and
    return true in case of both are true. This change makes the code more complex and takes longer
    execution time(very tiny) as it requires further condition check.

    The method checkRep() needs to remove the second assert. This change makes the code more efficient,
    and reduces the execution time of the method as it requires less assertion check.


3. Alternate Rep Invariant
    The constructor RatTerm(RatNum c, int e) needs to change. In case of passing in NaN, it
    should be "NaN" instead of "NaN*x^e" in order to handle this special case. This changes
    makes the code more clear.


4. Preferred Invariants TODO: FIXME
    Both. The reason is that these two rep invariants could avoid special cases like NaN*x^2,
    0*x^2. In this case, there is no need to consider these cases when doing the arithmetic
    calculations.
