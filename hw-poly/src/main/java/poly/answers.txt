1. Weakened Rep Invariant
    The constructor RatNum(int n, int d) needs to remove calling gcd() method
    to meet the new rep invariant. This change is more efficient as it bypass
    the procedure of calling gcd(), making the execution to be faster.

    The methods hashCode() and equals(Object obj) need to add calling gcd()
    method to so that they could treat numbers that are in reduced form and
    numbers that are not in reduced form at same standard. Then, both methods
    could return the correct results. This change is less efficient as it needs
    extra execution of gcd(), making the overall execution time to be longer.

    The method toString() needs to add calling gcd() method to meet the new
    rep invariant. This change is less efficient as it requires extra execution,
    making the overall execution time to be longer.


2. Alternate add, sub, mul, div
    The changes fail to meet the specifications of the methods because the specs
    of these methods don't have @sepc.modifies clause, meaning it should not be
    modified by the methods.
    The changes fail to meet the specifications of the RatNum class because the
    general spec of the class says that RatNum represents an immutable rational
    number, whereas the changes will mutate numbers.


3. Constructor checkReps
    The reason why calling checkRep only at the end of the constructors is already
    sufficient is that the RatNum class represents immutable rational numbers.
    These instance variables are initialized at the very beginning and declared as
    final, and no methods could even modify them as they are just doing arithmetic
    work. Therefore, calling checkRep only at the end of the constructors is
    sufficient to maintain the rep invariant.
