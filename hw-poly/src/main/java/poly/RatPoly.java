    // For a RatPoly p, let C(p,i) be "p.terms.get(i).getCoeff()" and
    // E(p,i) be "p.terms.get(i).getExpt()"
    // length(p) be "p.terms.size()"
    // (These are helper functions that will make it easier for us
    // to write the remainder of the specifications. They are not
    // executable code; they just represent complex expressions in a
    // concise manner, so that we can stress the important parts of
    // other expressions in the spec rather than get bogged down in
    // the details of how we extract the coefficient for the 2nd term
    // or the exponent for the 5th term. So when you see C(p,i),
    // think "coefficient for the ith term in p".)
    //
    // Abstraction Function:
    // RatPoly, p, represents the polynomial equal to the sum of the
    // RatTerms contained in 'terms':
    // sum (0 <= i < length(p)): p.terms.get(i)
    // If there are no terms, then the RatPoly represents the zero
    // polynomial.
    //
    // Representation Invariant for every RatPoly p:
    // terms != null &&
    // forall i such that (0 <= i < length(p)), C(p,i) != 0 &&
    // forall i such that (0 <= i < length(p)), E(p,i) >= 0 &&
    // forall i such that (0 <= i < length(p) - 1), E(p,i) > E(p, i+1)
    // In other words:
    // * The terms field always points to some usable object.
    // * No term in a RatPoly has a zero coefficient.
    // * No term in a RatPoly has a negative exponent.
    // * The terms in a RatPoly are sorted in descending exponent order.
    // (It is implied that 'terms' does not contain any null elements by the
    // above
    // invariant.)
